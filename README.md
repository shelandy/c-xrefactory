# C-xrefactory - A refactoring tool for C/Java and Emacs

Once there was [http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk) providing a free Java and C version, and a paid C++ version of xref. Development seems to have been headed by a [Marián Vittek](http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/w/Marian_Vittek/en), but it has been no support on [http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk) (mostly) for many years.  Later, c-xref, a limited to C and Emacs branch of xref,  is  available under GPL already 2009 on  [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/) by Marián.

Thomas Nilefalk decided to pick this up and moving it to GitHub. Although C-xref pretends to be only for C, it is all but identical to the full C/Java browser.

For newbies, However, trying to use it beyond the scope of C/java, is not so trival.  I decide to fork this in 2016 focusing to make it to cover the  support of Processing and Ardurino languages, so students, makers and educators can be benefit from using it to build a project quickly yet remain the option for making a much larger software project as the software professsionals.
